* Terminals: Basic symbols from which strings are formed, also called token name.

* Nonterminals: Syntactic variables that denote sets of strings.

* Production: What nonterminals produce, the manner in which the terminals and nonterminals can be combined to form strings.

* Grammar: The combination of termination symbols, nonterminal symbols, productions (nonterminal output).

* The language: The strings that we derive from the grammar.

* Parse Tree: Finding a tree that can be used to derive/yield a string in the language.

* Parsing: The process of finding a parse tree for a given string of terminals.

* Ambiguous grammar: A grammar that can have more than one parse tree that can generate a given string.

* Associativity: The side to which the operator belongs to if the operator is within two tokens.

* Syntax-directed translation scheme: Attaching rules or program feature to productions in a grammar.
