+++

After spending the last two weeks of July in vacations, August arrived full of activities.

First, and most notably, I've started sharing [my Obsidian notes](https://notes.betoissues.com) in a subdomain (you will notice the update in the top menu), along with some logs of little experiments or random thoughts I have without feeling the pressure of writing a full article. The process I'm using is currently mentioned in this [log entry](https://notes.betoissues.com/log/2024-08-24-publishing-obsidian-notes/).

## Writing

Besides my notes site, which has mostly been notes I've already written in my Obsidian vault. I've continued my Focus Series, the second part is almost ready, pending to finish the last section. Little spoiler, it's going to be about "how" we use our Focus.

## Community

Been assisting (to some) and watching the webinars in preparation for [Copa's Hackathon](https://hackathoncopa.com/), and will continue doing so in September.

I also got a heads-up to confirm participation in PyCON Panama, which I hope turns out great. Feel free to reach out for more information about this, I will share the event's link once it's up.

## Books

I haven't been reading too many books, the last one I completed was in June/July (Optimal by Daniel Goleman).

- Linux System Programming Techniques by Jack-Benny Persson, continued this one for a refresher on Linux programming since it's been a while since I've done something different to web development or automations. Currently at Chapter 11, reading about threads in C.

## Articles

Every month I read a bunch of articles, these are the ones that caught most of my attention.

- [Threads and Semaphores Examples by Julie Zelenski](https://see.stanford.edu/materials/icsppcs107/23-Concurrency-Examples.pdf): a good document about semaphores with examples of different types of semaphores.
- [The Impressionist Blogging Movement](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/impressionist-blogging/): to provoke some thinking about the AI situation and the mindset required to get the most of it. I'm not into the AI technicalities, so I usually prefer limiting my thoughts on the psychology part and how it affects us as individuals and society.
- [Rust for Filesystems](https://lwn.net/Articles/978738/): this one goes along a video, which I mostly watched because of the controversy it caused, about conducts already well-known within the Linux kernel community. Found it while reading about this [email](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240828211117.9422-1-wedsonaf@gmail.com/).
- [A skeptic's first contact with Kubernetes](https://blog.davidv.dev/posts/first-contact-with-k8s/): yet to finish this one, although I shared the thought about how learning Kubernetes is accommodation of already known concepts (for sysadmins) in a systematized way.

## Videos

- [The Insane Engineering of the Gameboy](https://youtube.com/watch/?v=BKm45Az02YE): I always enjoy a well-explained technical video. A plus to this one for being about such a symbolic piece of hardware.
- [A quick look at my homelab](https://youtu.be/-b3t37SIyBs): someone just living the dream of having "homelab" which could easily be considered an enterprise solution.

## Work

Besides catching up with threads and tasks, I had the opportunity to prepare two presentations this month. One for [Rootstack's 2024 Event](https://rootstack.com/en/blog/celebrating-technological-innovation-rootstack-2024-event) about AWS offerings in general, and a second presentation for colleagues with on the topic of _Message Brokers and EventBridge_.

## Gaming

I had fun playing some Euro/America Truck Simulator at the end of my vacations.

Black Myth: Wukong would be the highlight, I still need to spend more time in it, but so far a great game.
