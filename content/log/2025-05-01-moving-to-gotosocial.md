A couple of weeks ago I read an article about [GoToSocial](https://gotosocial.org/) (apparently I lost the link, but will update if I find it), an ActivityPub server for the Fediverse, along the lines of Mastodon and similar microblogging.

In the past I had already thought about self-hosting my own Mastodon or Pleroma instances, but the requirements for them always held me back. I wasn't planning on hosting a community server for a bunch of people, just a simple instance where I could share quick thoughts. That's the main reason I resonated with GoToSocial and set it up under my nixden domain.

[My first post in GoToSocial](https://gts.nixden.net/@beto/statuses/01JRNYSVR4Q3PQFV0B3VY0X7CY)

It was a coincidence that this week [Kev](https://kevquirk.com/blog/my-thoughts-on-the-fosstodon-drama) and [Mike](https://mikestone.me/2025-04-28-do-what-you-love) posted their thoughts regarding some Fosstodon drama, which motivated me more to continue using my recently set up instance as my main instance.

From now on, feel free to find me as @beto@nixden.net or directly on https://gts.nixden.net/@beto.

I'll keep my Fosstodon account for a couple months for reposts and sharing from my new account, expecting to stop using it soon.

If anyone's interested reach out to me and I'll share the steps to set up an instance; it's really not difficult at all.
