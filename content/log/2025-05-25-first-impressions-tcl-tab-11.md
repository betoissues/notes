After yesterday's article about [Zotero](2025-05-23-multi-device-zotero.md), I went to the store to try the different tablets available. Before going I checked the store's website and noticed the TCL tabs and the mention of NXT technology.

I had already read a bit about them on Reddit, but didn't pay much attention. Considering the price range and the bundled hardware (T-pen, cover, Keyboard...), I watched a few videos and decided the best thing to do was to try it out.

At the store they did have the S6 Lite but not on display; luckily the TCL Tab 11 was. At first glance, colors were already decent for the price, the size about right, and it was in desktop mode when I arrived (with Dex being one of the selling points for the Galaxy).

But I was there for the NXT technology which supposedly is better for a tablet used for reading. Fiddled a bit with it and I really liked it, and I can attest on how noticeable the glare is reduced.

I'll go more in-depth about it in the coming weeks. I've been using it since yesterday without major issues for reading and taking notes.

In fact, I'm using the included stylus right now to write this post in Obsidian with the handwriting keyboard.

For the same price tag as the S6 Lite on Amazon this might be a better value for my needs.
