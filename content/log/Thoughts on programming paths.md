When it comes to computers, my interests are fairly broad. Starting back in 2007 with some basic HTML websites, jumping into some game development in Visual Basic 6 (I know, right?), working on Python APIs as a freelance, to dealing with a variety of PHP and JS frameworks.

While nowadays my focus leans towards system's administration, DevOps, automations (so no heavy programming), I always get the itch when reading about changes in specific languages, or presentations on how different systems work at the code level.

It's always been there, the abstract thinking about how different things can be achieved. My struggle has always been sticking to a single one and learning more in-depth about its workings. One of the latest projects I tried was already 5 months ago, writing a text editor in Go[^1].

Today, I've been cleaning up my "read later" list of blog posts, removed right away almost everything related to web frontend development, and the only posts that stayed were related to systems programming or "service" applications like databases, servers, and other network-related programs. Most topics I've never really experienced with before.

In fact, this log came up after reading about OS Dev[^2] and feeling a bit of guilt for not finishing my side projects. This is something I really want to tackle.

For now, I'll keep reading about them trying to find the path I truly like, and continue my little experimentation projects until something clicks.

As for the sysadmin part of things, I did a bit of experimentation with Grafana, as I pointed out in my previous log[^3], and a real dive in Kubernetes[^4] is planned for the upcoming months.

This "log" is an attempt to be more conscious and include some sort of accountability about the progress I do in tech, so hopefully there will be news about my most recent learnings along this path.
