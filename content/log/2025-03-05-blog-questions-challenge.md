Since the beginning of 2025 I've found [a couple](https://kevquirk.com/blog/blog-questions-challenge), [blog](https://mikestone.me/20250106-blog-questions-challenge) [posts](https://atthis.link/blog/2025/36390.html) as part of the Blog Questions challenge, and thought about briefly sharing my answers to these questions. So here's mine, 2 months after I planned on answering.

## Why did you start blogging in the first place?

I'm not really sure, in 2006 I wrote a couple songs in the classroom with a friend. They had meaningless lyrics, but this is my earliest memory of writing.

After that, I started writing poems, until 7th/8th grade where my writing transformed into thoughts, opinions and essays at some point. I think it was around then, first sharing my poems, then some PC tutorials, some small thoughts, until it became my current blog with a mix of long and short form posts.

## What platform are you using to manage your blog, and why do you use it?

I migrated my previous website to Hugo this year, and now everything in here comes from a subdirectory in my Obsidian vault, hence the notes section.

## How do you write your posts?

I almost always write the outline using pen and paper. After which I develop the ideas directly in my computer using Neovim.

Sometimes I do use my pen to write the full draft. It's always pen, I don't like writing with pencils. My favorite pens are fine point 0.5mm by M&G (different models), since I don't use a lot of pressure when writing.

## Do you normally publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit?

Yes, most of the time I do publish immediately, just to notice the typos afterwards. Sometimes I've waited, but 24 hours tops.

## Have you blogged on other platforms before?

Yes, back in the day I started with Blogspot, then WordPress, Ghost, Jekyll, Zola, until I landed where I am right now.

## When do you feel most inspired to write?

Early mornings and nights. I tend to disconnect myself when writing, and these are the best moments for that.

## Whatâ€™s your favorite post on your blog?

"[El tiempo no espera a nadie](./2016-10-03-tiempo-no-espera-a-nadie.es.md)" I think was one of the first articles in which I shared a bit more about my thoughts and opinions. I also believe this defined a lot of my voice in this blog.

## Any future plans for the blog?

No, I'll keep writing, that's a given, there's not much more to it. Not right now.

However, I might have other plans for different types of content in other platforms regarding my hobbies like gym or music.

Thanks for reading! If you're a writer and haven't answered your blog questions for this year, I encourage you to do so and share them via email. I'll be glad to read them.
