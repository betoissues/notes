This page should be updated with technologies & tools I use on a regular basis.

## Software

[Zola](https://getzola.org) to generate my main blog, and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for the current website.

[NeoVim](https://neovim.io) for text-editing, along with a bunch of plugins. These configurations can be found in my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/betoissues/config)

[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux): I have a single [wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html) instance open, only switching to my browser most of the time; I'm more used to tmux than using a window manager.

[Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) is my note-taking app of choice, its plugins make it a powerful tool, helping me connect topics and generate ideas with very low friction. With a huge plus for using markdown files. Recently I've mostly edited the files using the NeoVim plugin.
